# This is a Jest API testing suite for the Urban Grocers app. I have created tests for the GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.
# All test suites pass successfully. However, this required restarting the server multiple times because of a 404 error.
# Before using the project, make sure that Node.js is installed as well as Visual Studio Code.
# How to run the project: 1) clone a copy of the project so that you have it located on your device. 2) run npm install from the console in your project folder. 3) if you have access to the Urban grocers api docs, you can use config.js to replace the API URL. 4) compile code in each javascript test file. 5) when you're ready to run the test, input the following command: 
# npx jest tests/testName.test.js. This will ensure that only one test is run at a time.
# Code style observed: camelCase, nouns as variables, function names that start with a verb, using const for variables that don't change.
