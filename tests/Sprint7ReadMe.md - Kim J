# This is a Jest API testing suite for the Urban Grocers app. I have created tests for the GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.
# Before using the project, make sure that Node.js is installed as well as Visual Studio Code.
# How to run the project: 1) clone a copy of the project so that you have it located on your device. 2) run npm install from the console in your project folder. 
# 3) if you have access to the Urban grocers api docs, you can use config.js to replace the API URL.
# Code style observed: camelCase, nouns as variables, function names that start with a verb, using const for variables that don't change.
